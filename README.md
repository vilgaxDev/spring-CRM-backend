# üìà Client Relationship Management (CRM) system
![STSTUS](https://img.shields.io/github/license/agiklo/CRM-System)
## General info
System (REST API) that enables the management of suppliers, employees, customers and products. Only authorized users with the rank of at least employee have access to the system functionality. Managers can create reports on products, customers, suppliers, etc. Such a report can be exported to a PDF or Excel file. The system is designed in such a way that only an administrator can register an account for a new user. The administrator fills in the registration form with the data of the new employee, then the employee receives an e-mail in which he must confirm the activation of the account. The system has a forum where employees can present their ideas and communicate with each other.
